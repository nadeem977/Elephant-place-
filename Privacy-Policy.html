                                At Revision AI, we strongly believe in privacy rights – and that those rights should not
                                differ depending on where you live in the world. That’s why we treat any data that
                                relates to an identified or identifiable individual or that is linked or linkable to
                                them by Revision AI as “personal data”, no matter where the individual lives. This means
                                that data that directly identifies you – such as your name – is personal data, and also
                                data that does not directly identify you, but that can reasonably be used to identify
                                you – such as the order number – is personal data. Aggregated is considered non-personal
                                data for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
                            </p>

                            This Privacy Policy covers how Revision AI Limited or its subsidiary (collectively,
                            “Revision AI”) handles personal data when you interact with us on our websites. Revision AI
                            may also link to third parties on our services. Revision AI’s Privacy policy does not apply

                            privacy policies and know your privacy rights before interacting with them.

                            undermine our legitimate use of data for anti-fraud and security purposes, such as when you
                            request deletion of an account that is being investigated for security concerns. Other
                            reasons your privacy request may be denied are if it jeopardises the privacy of other, is
                            frivolous or vexatious, or would be extremely impractical.</p>

                            Individuals: Revision AI may collect data about you from other individuals – for example, if
                            that individual has sent you a promo code, link to participate in Revision AI events or
                            shared content with you.
                            At Your Direction: You may direct other individuals or third parties to share data with
                            Revision AI. For example, you may direct your social media account provider to share data
                            about your account with Revision AI for an account set up.
                            Revision AI Partners: We may also validate the information you provide – for example, when
                            creating an account, with a third party for security and for fraud-prevention purposes.

                                To access certain Revision AI services, a child must have an account. When a child
                                applies for an account, permission should be sought from the parent. If a reasonable
                                request to close an account is received from a legal guardian, with supporting
                                documentation, the account will be closed by Revision AI and services for the account
                                will be suspended or terminated.
                                In addition, if we learn that a child’s personal data was collected without appropriate
                                authorisation, it will be deleted as soon as possible.

                                Revision AI generally treats data we collect using these cookies and similar
                                technologies as nonpersonal data. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP)
                                addresses, or similar identifiers are considered personal data by local law, we also
                                treat these identifiers as personal data in those regions. In addition, Revision AI
                                sometimes combines nonpersonal data collected from these technologies with other
                                personal data Revision AI holds. When we combine data in this way, we treat the combined
                                data as personal data for purposes of this Privacy Policy.
